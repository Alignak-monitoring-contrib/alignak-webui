Using the application
=====================

Login / logout
--------------

Assuming the default configuration has not changed, you can point your Web browser to::

    http://localhost:5001/


The application login page requires that a username and a password are typed. The user authentication
is made by the Alignak backend with user accounts which have been previously created in the backend.

With the backend default configuration, it should exist an `admin` user whose password is `admin`.
