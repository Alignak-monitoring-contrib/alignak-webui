Using the application
=====================

Login / logout
--------------

Assuming the default configuration has not changed, you can point your Web browser to::

    http://localhost:5001/


The application login page requires that a username and a password are typed. The user authentication is made by the Alignak backend with user accounts which have been previously created in the backend.

With the backend default configuration, it should exist an `admin` user whose password is `admin`.

User session
------------

Assuming the default configuration has not changed, the user session will be alive as long as the logged-in user's web browser is not closed.


Livestate
---------

The livestate page displays the current system live state
