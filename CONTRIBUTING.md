Contributing to webUI
=====================

Contributions to Web UI are welcome and encouraged, but please have a look through the guidelines in this document before raising an issue, or writing code for the project.


Using issues
------------

The issue tracker is the preferred channel for reporting bugs, requesting new features and submitting pull requests.

If you're suggesting a new feature, please take a look at **writing a new .


Reporting bugs
--------------

Well structured, detailed bug reports are hugely valuable for the project.

Guidlines for reporting bugs:

 - Check the issue search to see if it has already been reported
 - Isolate the problem to a simple test case
 - Clearly explain the problem and provide information about framework version, Web UI version, and browser version.

Please provide any additional details associated with the bug, if it's browser specific, or only happens with a certain configuration or data.


Pull requests
-------------

Clear, concise pull requests are excellent at continuing the project's community driven growth. 
But please review [these guidelines](https://github.com/blog/1943-how-to-write-the-perfect-pull-request) and the guidelines below before starting work on the project.

Guidelines:

 - Please create an issue first:
   - For bugs, we can discuss the fixing approach
   - For **enhancements**, we can discuss if it is within the project scope and avoid duplicate effort
